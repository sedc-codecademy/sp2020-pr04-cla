## Student projects 2020 - Product MVP 04 - Company Listing App

## 🧬 About the Idea and the Project 
Stems from the needs of our country and its neighboring countries for this business model/platform and the enthusiasm and knowledge of our team to fill this gap in the market.

## 🛰 The Necessity for this Application 
* Our research confirms that there is a need for such a platform in the Balkans, although technicaly there are several similar platforms in the EU and USA, such as: Glassdoor and Indeed, but our idea is different and it will open up many opportunities to all industries that will be able to make use of our platform with ease.

* Most of the small and mid-sized businesses use only domestic platforms to publish their company information and promote the products they sell. From the onset, this limits their expectations to expand their businesses and grow exponentially.

* The already available platforms are limited to only one or a couple of languages. There are some good ideas and applications out there, but they are restricted to their domestic market, which is closing the opportunity for international companies to be competitive.

## 🧩 Main Features 

* Customized and Interactive Map
* Powerful Search
* Promotions
* Recruitments
* Reviews

## 🛠 Languages, Technologies and Libraries

* HTML&CSS
* JavaScript
